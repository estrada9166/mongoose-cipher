# Mongoose Cipher

## Main Idea
The idea with Mongoose cipher is to encrypt the fields that you select before save them on the database.



## Installation
```bash
$ npm install mongoose-cipher
```
## Usage

### Basic
At the moment it only works with: 
+ `save`: it will encrypt the selected fields automatically
+ `findOneAndUpdate`: it will encrypt the selected fields automatically
+ `findOne`: it will decrypt the selected fields automatically

The data is encrypted using AES thanks to [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js).

#### Required options:
+ `fields`: An array list of the fields of the Schema to get encrypted.
+ `secret`: The secret used to encrypt the data.

### Example:

```JavaScript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { encryptFieldsÂ } = require('mongoose-cipher');
const Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const User = new Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  username: String
})

User.plugin(encryptFields, { fields: ['name', 'email', 'username'], secret: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'})
```
### Database data:
```
{
  _id: "5a5d480cc132a42b921fb010",
  name: "U2FsdGVkX19jWdf7xfM2xtZ7a5KdmM+q8WdLwP4c2hQ=",
  email: "U2FsdGVkX19GSMtPsgzybjkLl5OWG54gtdyyHYPKs2xBsNmCSnGX0hyuBjGpYGji",
  username: "U2FsdGVkX1/SU1MV/s/+w7tD5yiaKWrAhHN42N+J078=",
  __v: 0
}
```
